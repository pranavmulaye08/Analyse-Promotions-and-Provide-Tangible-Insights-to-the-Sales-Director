## About Project 📊

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for 🎯

Domain: FMCG 🛒

Function: Sales / Promotions 🎉

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant 🏬 with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India 🇮🇳. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 🪔 and Sankranti 2024 🌞 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. 

Now the sales director, Bruce Haryali, wanted this immediately but the analytics manager, Tony, is engaged on another critical project 🚀. Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey, who is the curious data analyst 🕵️‍♂️ of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes 📝 to Peter to support his work.
